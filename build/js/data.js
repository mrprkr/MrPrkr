		"synopsis": "A large web project requiring the redesign of surfingaustralia.com to a responsive, modern framework. The build required the design and execution of over 70 new page templates.",
		"description": "<p>The task to re-design Surfing Australia's primary web site was mammoth. With the requirements of a shop, events booking system, user profiles with 8 membership options, news, gallery, and logic to connect specific user permissions to each of these functions it was not an easy task... and it had to be replicated for eight different states. The timelines were incredibly tight with three months to deliver an estimated 70 page templates, each requireing careful design consiteration from us, and approval from the client. </p><br/><p>It was clear from the begining that we would have to be agile and lean in the design process to allow the developers to work along side out process and deliver on time. The deisgn team starting by mapping out the whole service, there were about 30 shared elements between all the pages ewhich included modules such as social share, photo gallery, text content and registration forms. Moving into an intense two day workshop, a design language was established which would dictate the visual and interactive treatments of each of the modules.</p><br/><p>The design team split with half working on service design and IA, and the other on visual asset production for client approval. Working like this for three weeks produced over 70 page templates and multiple revisions on each. To help us communicate with the client and development teams, the development of <a href='#/project/articular'>Articular</a> began.</p><br/><p>The design team delivered over 70 static visuals, an interactive styleguide with CSS styles and SASS mixins, Information Architecture, and Interaction Modeling.</p><br/><p>The service is currently undergoing testing before an early 2015 launch.</p>"

		"description": "<p>Articular takes complex design deliverables and articulates them into something everyone can undserstand. Working on large web projects often creates large collections of assets and visuals with poor versioning and organisation. I created Articular out of the need to have a one-stop place to always find the latest versions of the designs.</p><br/><p>Working with developers and project managers to identify core needs, the service highlights asset status, revisions, date updated, and a unique ID that can be referenced in communication to be sure we're all talking about the same thing.</p><br/><p>As the assets grew, so did the features and it became nessesary to be able to visualise the assets through the core-journeys. There is a journeys section that walks the user through the Information Architecture viusally to make sure that the assets are being stitched together correctly by the developers.</p><br/><p>Articular has helped a team of 6 developers, 2 designers and 3 project managers understand incredibly complex service design by consolidating, versioning, and simplifying design deliverables.</p><br/><br/><p>Articular is avaliable at <a href='http://articular.io'>articular.io</a> by request."

The service was a way for telstra to mitigate wait times by providing technical assistance and troubleshooting during the waiting period in the often busy store. The project combined the skills of a service, visual and interaction designer to imagine a digital service that could entertain and inform Telstra customers.</p><br/><p>This project used Telstra's existing content services such as Foxtel and  to enhance the waiting experience for customers and staff by providing entertainment options. It was also important to be used as a pager in the queuing system by allowing customers to join the queue and being transparent about existing wait time.</p><br/><p>We created a video to showase the process and evolution as the service went through three rounds of itterative user testing. The final deliverables included a prototype, interaction model and high fidelity screen visualisations.</p><br/><iframe src='//player.vimeo.com/video/119671116' width='100%' height='281' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe'>' <br/><br/>"

		"description": "<p>The project started with three design principles: The projects are featured first, information should be dynamic and shown only as you need it, and it must be available and feature complete for mobile devices.</p><br/><p>The process started with building a stack of web technologies that would allow the site to present information dynamically across a number of different screen sizes. This combined angular.js for data binding, isotope for a responsive tile layout, retina.js to optimise images, and CSS3 for animation.</p><br/> <p>The visual design is minimal, with the focus being on the student work in a series of responsive columns. The tiles are ordered randomly, so that every work is given equal real estate on the site, and for users who want to navigate the projects chronologically, there are options to sort by first, last, and project name.</p><br/><p>There’s a lot of work going on in the background too with functions to determine wether the student has an online portfolio and if the student’s name ends with an &rsquo;s&rsquo; to adjust the plurality accordingly.</p><br/><p> Retina.js dramatically reduces load time by checking to see the pixel density of the user's device and injecting the right resolution assets. The site won’t show the projects until every image is ready, ensuring the user experience is always consistent and animation accurate. The site plugs into the Contentful Content Management System, where students can submit and update their work which is pushed live to the site!</p><br/> <p>Beyond the landing page, each student has their own embedded space where they can submit their project story such as this one. The sites data binding framework, angular.js, takes the markup submitted by the students and renders it into HTML, allowing each of the students to curate their own project experience with additional images or multimedia content.</p><br/><p>The site can be viewed at <a href='http://id14.com' target='_blank'>id14.com</a></p>"
